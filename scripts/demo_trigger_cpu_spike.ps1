# HemoStat Demo: CPU Spike Scenario (PowerShell)
#
# This script triggers a CPU spike in the test-api service to demonstrate
# the end-to-end HemoStat workflow:
# Monitor detects high CPU → Analyzer recommends restart → Responder executes restart → Alert sends notification
#
# Usage: .\demo_trigger_cpu_spike.ps1 [duration] [intensity]
#   duration: Spike duration in seconds (default: 60)
#   intensity: CPU intensity 0.0-1.0 (default: 0.9 = 90%)
#
